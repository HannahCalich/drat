This drat repository contains copies of the `infomapecology (version 2.0)` and `emln (version 1.0)` packages and was created to help the `PhysMove` R package meet CRAN requirements.

Anyone looking to download the `infomapecology` or `emln` r packages should follow this link for the most up-to-date versions:

* `infomapecology`: https://ecological-complexity-lab.github.io/infomap_ecology_package/
* `emln`: https://github.com/Ecological-Complexity-Lab/emln

Drat allows you to create a simple package repository to host binary and/or source versions of another r package. More information about `drat` is available here:
